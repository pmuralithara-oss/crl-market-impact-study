**“Stock Market Reactions to FDA Complete Response Letters:  
Evidence from Deficiency Types, Firm Characteristics, and Tail Risk”**  
Pranav Muralitharan, Anoushka Banerjee (2026)

## Overview
We analyze stock market reactions to FDA Complete Response Letters (CRLs) using
a hand-collected dataset of regulatory events and standard event-study methods.
The primary outcome is cumulative abnormal returns around CRL issuance dates.

## Repository Structure
- `code/` – data construction, event study, and regression scripts  
- `data/processed/` – analysis-ready datasets (no raw FDA documents)  
- `output/` – figures and tables reported in the paper  
- `data_dictionary.txt` – variable definitions  

## Data Availability
Raw FDA documents and licensed market data are not redistributed.
Processed datasets are derived from publicly available regulatory records and
commercial financial data sources.

## Replication
Scripts are numbered in execution order. Running all scripts reproduces the
main tables and figures in the paper.
